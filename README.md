# Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval System: RAG Pipelines and Agent-Oriented Design

Welcome to the Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval System, a framework designed to dynamically retrieve, process, and generate knowledge-based responses using advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and agentic frameworks. This project is ideal for developers and researchers seeking to integrate language models, vector databases, and agent-oriented architectures for advanced question-answering and knowledge retrieval.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval and generation, allowing for context-aware responses.
- **Agent Framework**: Implements agent-based logic for query processing and interaction.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Efficient retrieval using vectorized embeddings for knowledge storage and access.
- **Dynamic Query Engine**: Allows customizable queries for flexibility in information retrieval.
- **Logging and Metrics**: Robust tracking of query performance and system health.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
